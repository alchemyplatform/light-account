///
/// This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
/// behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
/// external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
/// function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
///
/// The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
/// reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
/// case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
///
/// For example:
///
/// [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
/// ```solidity
/// contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
///     function initialize() initializer public {
///         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
///     }
/// }
///
/// contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
///     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
///         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
/// possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
///
/// CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
/// that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
///
/// [CAUTION]
/// ====
/// Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
///
/// An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
/// contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
/// the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
///
/// [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
/// ```
/// /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
/// constructor() {
///     _disableInitializers();
/// }
